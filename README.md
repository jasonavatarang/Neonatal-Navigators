# Neonatal Navigators

## Project Overview
The **Neonatal Navigators** project focuses on developing a **neonatal neuroprotective care website and application** to assist healthcare practitioners in providing best-practice care for neonates. This project is designed to guide users through a decision tree structure, offering a comprehensive repository of **medical instructions**, **documents**, **illustrations**, and **video demonstrations**.

Initially, the project will be prototyped as a **private website** and later transitioned into an **Android application**. This solution is being co-designed with the collaboration of **UF Gainesville (UF GNV) Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics faculty and trainees** alongside providers from **UF Leesburg**. The ultimate goal is to create a functional, user-friendly, and adaptive tool that addresses the evolving needs of its users.

## Quickstart
In order to start the project locally, do the following:
open a terminal inside the "frontend" subfolder.
Run the following commands:
    npm install
    npm run dev

## Features
- **Decision Tree Navigation:** Guides users through tailored steps for neonates of varying gestational ages.
- **Comprehensive Resources:** Includes supporting documentation, video demonstrations, and written guidelines.
- **HIPAA Compliance:** Ensures patient data security by avoiding leaks and maintaining confidentiality.
- **Iterative Development:** Future versions will expand functionality based on user feedback to better meet healthcare needs.

## Example Use Cases
1. **Neonate Born at ≤32 Weeks:**
   - Recommendations include delayed cord clamping, minimizing stimulation, and avoiding fluid boluses.
   - Accompanied by video and/or written instructions.

2. **Neonates in Gestational Age Range of 33–35 Weeks:**
   - Tailored steps such as preventing excessive warmth or conducting additional assessments.

## Technology Stack

### Programming Languages
- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for website development.
- Additional tools for mobile app development will be added as the project progresses.

### Frameworks and Tools
- **React.js** for the website front-end development.
- **Android Studio** for building the mobile application.

The team will aim to minimize dependencies to keep maintenance costs low, given that the custodians of the project are likely healthcare faculty.

## Development Process
1. **Prototype Website Layout:**
   - Initial design with feedback from UF GNV and UF Leesburg healthcare teams.
2. **Populate Website with Content:**
   - Add medical resources, including written guidelines and video demonstrations.
3. **Android App Development:**
   - Develop an alpha version of the mobile application with input from users.
4. **Iterative Updates:**
   - Regularly expand features based on user feedback to maintain relevance and functionality.

## Future Plans
If the initial version is too simple, the development process will focus on:
- Adding expanded features to meet user needs.
- Enhancing flexibility for broader applications in healthcare.
